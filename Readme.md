# Functionality
As long as this mod is enabled, combat skills (not combat level mind you) cannot exceed the level of your **lowest** non-combat skill.

**IMPORTANT**: This mod uses the same functionality as the base game itself. Therefore, if you add a non-combat skill later into your character, then you **mustn't** do any combat until that new skill has been levelled! **Otherwise, upon gaining xp in a combat skill, said skill's xp will end up getting reduced**! (There is a failsafe for hitpoints to not fall below level 10 though)
