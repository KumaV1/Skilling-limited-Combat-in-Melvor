# Functionality
As long as this mod is enabled, combat skills (not combat level mind you) cannot exceed the level of your **lowest** non-combat skill.

Already existing combat skill levels are not reset, though. So you can add additional skill mods no problem, though you will have to level that one up before you can get any further gains in the combat skills.
