# Functionality
As long as this mod is enabled, combat skills (not combat level mind you) cannot exceed the level of your **lowest** non-combat skill.

**IMPORTANT**: This mod uses the same functionality as the base game itself. 
Therefore, if you add a non-combat skill later into your character, then you **mustn't** do any combat until that new skill has been levelled! 
**Otherwise, upon gaining xp in a combat skill, said skill's xp will end up getting reduced**! (There is a failsafe for hitpoints to not fall below level 10 though)

So, to better be safe than sorry, you may want to keep up-to-date save files, or at least create ones before adding a new skill to your character. 
For that, you may want to take a look at the [SOS! Save Preservor](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/sos-save-preserver) mod, which can take the manual work of that off you.
